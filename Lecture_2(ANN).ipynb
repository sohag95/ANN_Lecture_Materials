        "Numpy is a great framework, but it cannot utilize GPUs to accelerate its numerical computations. For modern deep neural networks, GPUs often provide speedups of 50x or greater, so unfortunately numpy won't be enough for modern deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we introduce the most fundamental PyTorch concept: the Tensor. A PyTorch Tensor is conceptually identical to a numpy array: a Tensor is an n-dimensional array, and PyTorch provides many functions for operating on these Tensors. Any computation you might want to perform with numpy can also be accomplished with PyTorch Tensors; you should think of them as a generic tool for scientific computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "However unlike numpy, PyTorch Tensors can utilize GPUs to accelerate their numeric computations. To run a PyTorch Tensor on GPU, you use the device argument when constructing a Tensor to place the Tensor on a GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here we use PyTorch Tensors to fit a two-layer network to random data. Like the numpy example above we manually implement the forward and backward passes through the network, using operations on PyTorch Tensors:"

        "\n",
        "Thankfully, we can use automatic differentiation to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The autograd package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using autograd, the forward pass of your network will define a computational graph; nodes in the graph will be Tensors, and edges will be functions that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.\n",
        "\n",
        "This sounds complicated, it's pretty simple to use in practice. If we want to compute gradients with respect to some Tensor, then we set requires_grad=True when constructing that Tensor. Any PyTorch operations on that Tensor will cause a computational graph to be constructed, allowing us to later perform backpropagation through the graph. If x is a Tensor with requires_grad=True, then after backpropagation x.grad will be another Tensor holding the gradient of x with respect to some scalar value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes you may wish to prevent PyTorch from building computational graphs when performing certain operations on Tensors with requires_grad=True; for example we usually don't want to backpropagate through the weight update steps when training a neural network. In such scenarios we can use the torch.no_grad() context manager to prevent the construction of a computational graph.\n",
